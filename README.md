# scIHPF: single-cell Integrative Hierarchical Poisson Factorisation 


Python package for data integration in scRNA-seq datasets extending Hierarchical Poisson Factorisation model by Blei et al. (2017) and [scHPF](https://github.com/simslab/scHPF) by Levitin et al. (2019)

This is code associated with the paper:

## Issues 

Please refer to [Github Page of scHPF](https://schpf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#numba-compatibility) for installing numba or other Python dependencies. It is documented that for incorrect combinations of numba and Python versions, the optimisation algorithm will fail.
